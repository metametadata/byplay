# Byplay

Clojure background job queue on top of PostgreSQL 9.5.

The project is mostly inspired by [Que](https://github.com/chanks/que),
[Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque/) and [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery).

## Features
- **Durability**: queue can survive app restarts because it is stored inside a PostgreSQL table.
All done and failed jobs are left in a table
so that at any time user is able inspect, retry or purge them manually.
- **Embedment**: queue consumption worker can be easily started in a background thread.
- **Parallelism**: queue can be consumed by several threads to better utilize multiple CPU cores.
The parallel queue consumption is based on 
[FOR UPDATE/SKIP LOCKED](http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/) feature from PostgreSQL 9.5.
- **Transactional guarantees**:
    - Every job is executed inside its own database transaction.
    - If job is marked *done* than all its database statements were also committed.
    - In case of exception inside a job all job's database statements are rolled back 
    (using an SQL savepoint) before marking a job *failed*.
    Thus if job is marked *new* or *failed* then none of its database statements were committed.   
- **Multiple queues**: jobs can be scheduled to different queues/tags.
E.g. you can schedule heavy jobs into a separate "slow" queue/worker 
in order to not block an execution of more important jobs from a "light" queue. 

## Installation

Add dependency to your project:

```clj
[byplay "0.1.0"]
```

Require a namespace:

```clj
(ns my-app.core
  (:require
    [byplay.core :as b]
    ,,,))
```

## Quickstart

### Initialization

On your app start setup Byplay table and the accompanying indexes in the database (it's safe to call this function more than once):

```clj
(b/migrate jdbc-conn)
```

Here `jdbc-conn` is a "raw" [JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) connection.
There are different ways to obtain such instance:

1) Via [funcool/clojure.jdbc](https://funcool.github.io/clojure.jdbc/latest/#creating-a-connection) JDBC wrapper:

```clj
(with-open [conn (jdbc.core/connection dbspec)]
  (let [jdbc-conn (jdbc.proto/connection conn)]
    ,,,))
```

2) Via [clojure/java.jdbc](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/home.html#reusing-connections) JDBC wrapper:

```clj
(clojure.java.jdbc/with-db-connection [conn db-spec]
  (let [jdbc-conn (clojure.java.jdbc/db-connection conn)]
    ,,,))
```

3) Via JDBC datasource (e.g. [HikariCP](https://github.com/tomekw/hikari-cp#postgresql-example)):
 
```clj
(with-open [jdbc-conn (.getConnection datasource)]
    ,,,)
```

### Job Definition

Define a job function:

```clj
(defn ^{::b/queue :my-queue} my-job
  [ctx x y z]
  (do-something-in-job-transaction (:jdbc-conn ctx))
  ,,,)
```

Here `(:jdbc-conn ctx)` is a JDBC connection with the current transaction in progress.

Queue metadata is optional.

### Scheduling

Put the job into `:my-queue` (as specified in job's metadata at `:byplay.core/queue` key):

```clj
(b/schedule jdbc-conn #'my-job 1 2 3)
```

You can also explicitly specify another queue using `schedule-to`:

```clj
(b/schedule-to jdbc-conn :another-queue #'my-job 1 2 3)
```

### Working

Define an instance of [funcool/clojure.jdbc](https://funcool.github.io/clojure.jdbc/latest/#connection-parameters) 
database specification, e.g.:

```clj
(def dbspec {:classname   "org.postgresql.Driver"
             :subprotocol "postgresql"
             :subname     "//localhost:5432/myapp"})
```

Start a background worker with 2 concurrent work threads, each polling the specified queue for a new job every 5 seconds: 

```clj
(b/start (b/new-worker dbspec {:threads-num      2
                               :queues           [:my-queue]
                               :polling-interval 5000
                               :on-fail          (fn on-fail
                                                   [worker exc {:keys [id job args queue state] :as _job}]
                                                   ,,,)}))
```

`on-fail` function will be called if exception is thrown from the job.

### Shutdown

You can ask a worker to finish all currently running jobs and stop polling a database with `interrupt` method.
For example this is how a worker can be gracefully stopped in 
[the application shutdown hook](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook\(java.lang.Thread\)):

```clj
(.addShutdownHook (Runtime/getRuntime)
                      (Thread. #(do
                                 ; stop the worker (before any other services which still running jobs may depend on)
                                 (doto worker b/interrupt b/join)
                                 
                                 ; stop other services
                                 ,,,)))
```

## Tips

### Jobs should be idempotent whenever possible.
Because in rare cases a job may be started more than once.
E.g. a worker may die in the middle of a job execution leaving this job in *new* state.

Thanks to transactional guarantees, if job only updates the database then you don't have to worry about this problem.
Just don't forget to use a connection from the job context. 

### Use database connection pool to speed things up.
See [funcool/clojure.jdbc docs](https://funcool.github.io/clojure.jdbc/latest/#connection-pool).
Otherwise Byplay will create a new connection to the database on every poll.
 
### Job signatures are important.
If you schedule a job and than rename its namespace/function than worker won't find the job var and will fail the task.
Also be careful with changing job args.

### Worker can throw exceptions in background threads.
It is possible that an exception can occur in the worker thread outside of a job function.
By default such exceptions silently kill a background thread. So it's a good practice to be ready to explicitly detect them with
[Thread/setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler](https://stuartsierra.com/2015/05/27/clojure-uncaught-exceptions).
